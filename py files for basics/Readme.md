# Python Scripts for LangChain Basics

This directory contains a collection of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks designed to explore the fundamental concepts of the LangChain library. Each file focuses on specific aspects, building up from simple examples to more complex interactions with language models.

## Scripts

-   **`chat-1.py`**: (Placeholder: Add a brief description of what this script demonstrates, e.g., "Basic LLM interaction.")
-   **`chat-2.py`**: (Placeholder: Add a brief description, e.g., "Introduction to ChatModels and message types.")
-   **`chat-3.py`**: (Placeholder: Add a brief description, e.g., "Working with Prompt Templates.")
-   **`chat-4.py`**: (Placeholder: Add a brief description, e.g., "Implementing simple chains.")
-   **`chat-5.py`**: Implements a command-line interface (CLI) chatbot using Azure OpenAI. It demonstrates managing chat history and using system messages.
-   **`grok.py`**: (Placeholder: Add a brief description of this script's purpose.)

## Notebooks

-   **`notebooks/notebook-1.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation with LangChain features, visualizations, or more detailed explorations. (Placeholder: Add more specific details if available, e.g., "Focuses on data loading and RAG.")

## Purpose

The primary goal of these files is to provide hands-on examples for learning LangChain. They are intended to be run individually to understand specific functionalities.

## How to Use

1.  Ensure you have all dependencies installed from the main `requirements.txt` in the root of the `langchain` project.
2.  Set up your environment variables (e.g., for Azure OpenAI) as described in the main project `Readme.md`.
3.  Navigate to this directory (`py files for basics`) in your terminal.
4.  Run the Python scripts directly:
    ```powershell
    python chat-1.py
    python chat-5.py
    ```
5.  For the Jupyter Notebook, start a Jupyter server and open `notebooks/notebook-1.ipynb`.

Feel free to modify and experiment with these scripts as you learn!
